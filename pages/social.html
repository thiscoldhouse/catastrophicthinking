  CatastrophicThinking.com is not on social media. If you can, I encourage you all to delete your accounts on these platforms. There is a wealth of evidence that Facebook et al are not only bad for the health of civil society, but for your personal, individual health as well.

  To my fellow software engineers: if you work for Facebook, you have a moral obligation to leave.

  I know we all have to make complicated decisions in an immoral economy. I can't speak to non-engineering roles, but here is what I can say: it is so easy to find another job in software. If you work for Facebook, continuing your current employment is not morally justifiable. If you work for Facebook and are thinking of quitting, please <a target="_blank" href="mailto:hello@catastrophicthinking.com">email me</a>. I am happy to help in your job search if I can. There are so many good things software is capable of doing for the world. Do not waste your life making Facebook's shareholders rich.
