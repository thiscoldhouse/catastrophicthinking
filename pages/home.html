  Remember the internet circa 2010, when we still thought it was a good idea? Remember when Google's slogan was "Don't Be Evil," and you were glad that Facebook helped you keep up with your extended family?

  During the Arab Spring, the consensus was that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2011/09/12/new-study-quantifies-use-of-social-media-in-arab-spring/">"social media carried a cascade of messages about freedom and democracy across North Africa and the Middle East, and helped raise expectations for the success of political uprising."</a> We were so naive!

  The internet was not perfect, but it was hopeful and fun. In the last decade, it has become clear that corporations have not just allowed, but actively encouraged bad faith actors to weoponize the web in order to drive engagement and maximize profits. They have done this at the expense of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2021/11/the-facebook-papers-what-do-they-mean-from-a-human-rights-perspective/" target="_blank">human rights</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/the-facebook-papers-covid-vaccine-misinformation-c8bbc569be7cc2ca583dadb4236a0613" target="_blank">global health</a>, and <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=h05WDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=facebook+civil+society&ots=WglHZ-mhzB&sig=_k1vTpG8Tq9vtFrI74rcv-mC9NA#v=onepage&q=facebook%20civil%20society&f=false" target="_blank">civil society</a>. That website you use to see pictures of your nieces and nephews is <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26508117" target="_blank">directly implicated in ethnic cleansing</a>.

  This is a place for the things I make that try to make the web a better place. This website won't track you or display ads. It won't spread conspiracy theories, talk about "migrant caravans," or villainize the homeless. It will, however, troll the shit out of Ben Shapiro, Tucker Carlson, Texas anti-abortion activists, and others. The name is taken from the title of Ben Shapiro's 2020 book <i>Catastrophic Thinking</i>, which itself borrowed the term from psychology. I think it perfectly describes the pathological thought patterns of the collective human mind that is the internet. When I saw he did not think to buy the domain, how could I resist?
