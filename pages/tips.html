  These projects take a lot of time, expertise, and, unfortunately, some money. If you throw me a few bucks, that will go directly towards costs. I've been lucky enough to receive substantial support from wonderful, generous people who have skills I lack. I dream of a world where I can pay them for their time - even if it's just a token amount.

  In the unlikely event that I receive enough tips to cover my costs, I'll update this page with a thorough explanation of how I plan on using the money. For now, it mostly goes to buying domains and running servers.
